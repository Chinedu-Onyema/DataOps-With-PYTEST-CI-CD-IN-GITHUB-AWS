## I Created A Continous Integration & Continous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline For The Nigrian Customs Service (NCS), With Pytest Using GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Actions and AWS CodeBuild.

I tested my code efficiency using a local enviroment like GitHub Codespaces and continously deployed it using GitHub Actions and AWS codebuild.

GitHub Codespaces(local) = Developer enviroment
AWS CloudShell(Cloud) = Developer enviroment

GitHub Actions(Cloud) = Development environment
AWS CodeBuild(Cloud) = Development environment
